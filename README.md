# The World's First Open Source Custom Bible web app

## What this project is about 
Hi, my name is Steven. I'm a Christian programmer looking to get more young people who have a relationship with the lord into programming. This project is not only open to Christians but anyone who wants to learn more about the religion while strengthening their programming skills. 

## The Basics
The backbone of this application is to simply be able to read the Bible but I am looking to grow this project into something more feature rich in the future. This main branch will be known as Phase 0 in the begining as this is just the inital commit. Each phase/feature/sprint will have their own respective branches and will be merged periodically as the project progresses.

## The Vision
The vision I have with this app is to allow people to be able to make their own accounts, save verses in their own profile, and even connect with local congregations to make a community out of this.
